# Introduction

As an individual with data analysis skills, I am interested in digging through the daily Covid data by using SQL analytics clauses and visualize the result by using Power BI, so that I can understand more behind the numbers, such as how the Covid spreads, what is the vaccination process for every country in the world, and much more.  

<b> Data Source: </b>

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 

<b> Tables: </b>
1. Covid Deaths for population per country and Covid daily statistics like total cases, new cases, total deaths, icu patients, etc.
2. Covid Vaccinations for Covid daily vaccination statistics per country. 

## The following skillsets are exemplified in SQL queries

Converting data type

Windows Functions

Joins

Is Null

Aggregate Functions

Subquery

CTE

Temp Tables

etc.

## The queries answer the following 9 questions

-- Global summary of total new cases, total deaths and death percentage if infected with Covid

-- The highest death counts each continent

-- Canada's percentage of death if infected with Covid

-- America's percentage of population infected with Covid

-- Highest infection percentage compared to population for each country

-- Top 10 countries with highest death count per population

-- Canada's running total vaccinations count for people received at least one vaccine

-- Country's percentage of population that people received at least one vaccine

-- Top 100 countries' percentage of population that people fully vaccinations
